# ABCC_AGXXR_Project
A repository for the Applied Bioinformatics and Cloud Computing group project, focusing on reproducing the NGS data analysis from the paper 'The AGXXÂ® Antimicrobial Coating Causes a Thiol-Specific Oxidative Stress Response and Protein S-bacillithiolation in Staphylococcus aureus' by Loi et al 2018.
The genome assembly and annotation for Staphylococcus aureus USA300_TCH1516 (accession number CP000730) were obtained from NCBI GenBank.
The SDRF (Sample and Data Relationship Format) file, a tab-delimited metadata file that maps samples to their data files, was downloaded from the ArrayExpress functional genomics data collection.
